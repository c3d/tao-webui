<h1>[[caption]]</h1>

<p>
  <em>[[caption]]</em> is a dynamically animated slide theme featuring
  smooth transitions between automatically generated backgrounds.
</p>
<p>
  The dynamic backgrounds use saturated colors and mostly rectangle
  shapes. There is a transition between pages, as well as a transition
  at regular intervals. As a result, the page background never look
  exactly the same twice.
