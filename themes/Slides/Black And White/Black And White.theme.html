<h1>[[caption]]</h1>

<p>
  <em>[[caption]]</em> is a collection of simple, non-intrusive,
  color-neutral themes. These themes use only levels of gray, which
  make them applicable in a number of graphical contexts.
  You can use the themes directly, or as a starting point for your own
  slide designs.
