<h1>[[caption]]</h2>

<p>
  <em>[[caption]]</em> is a collection of pages to create a simple
  movie credits animation similar to the Star Wars intro, using the <a href="http://www.taodyne.com/docs/help/en/group___movie_credits.html" target="_blank">Movie Credits</a> module. This collection features five different configurable screens.
</p>

<h2>Introduction screen</h2>

<p>
  The introduction screen shows your message flying towards you, in
  large letters with a green outline.

<h2>Location screen</h2>

<p>

  presentation. You can use it to say where you are presenting and
  who you are presenting to.
