The Tao Presentations Web User Interface (webui) is a tool to help users of
Tao Presentations create documents based on predefined themes.

It is made of two main parts, both running on the user's computer:
- A NodeJS server,
- A web application based on the ExtJS 4 framework from http://www.sencha.com/.

The whole project is released under the GNU General Public Library License
version 3.0 as published by the Free Software Foundation and appearing in the
file LICENSE included in the packaging of this file.
